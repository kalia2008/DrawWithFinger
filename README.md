# DrawWithFinger
As gamers, we frequently employ various gaming devices to enhance our interaction with machines. However, in today's environmentally conscious world, the rampant production of such devices raises concerns. Moreover, the global inequality we confront often denies this privilege to many. Fortunately, emerging technologies offer solutions. this  project harnesses Machine Learning and OpenCV to propose alternatives, utilizing hand gestures as the controller. The provided Python example demonstrates drawing on the screen using hand gestures, but it can also be adapted for use with pygame to control games or integrated into other game engines. This project was undertaken during the winter semester of 2021/2022 at UDK, focusing on OpenCV.
